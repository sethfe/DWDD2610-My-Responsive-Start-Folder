Hello my name is Seth Elliott and I work for Empire design Co, which is an architectural firm located in New York City. This company has been around for over 30 years, adding and developing new projects throughout the city and across all five boroughs. Whether it be new construction or preserving and remodeling old construction to keep the richness of New York City's architecture alive, this is why we're excited to bring to you our new project which will be in Brooklyn Heights! This will be our first time venturing down to Brooklyn Heights, it's an up-and-coming area we'll be doing some high-rises maybe a few brown stones, and as well as maybe some condos we will be there probably doing construction and things until about 2025. So if you're a business or if you're looking to move look for our company stamp, and we're excited to be here in Brooklyn Heights and we'll see you soon.
